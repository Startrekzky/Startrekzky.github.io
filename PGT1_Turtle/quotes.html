                                    <p>"PowerPoint makes us stupid."<br/>- General James N. Mattis, USMC</p>
                                    <p>"The best way to do something 'lean' is to gather a tight group of people, give them very little money, and very little time."<br/>- Bob Klein, chief engineer of the F-14 program</p>
                                    <p>"But camels, though odious to view and endowed with the offensive spirit, did not enjoy the blessing of pachydermaty."<br/>- F. E. Adcock, The Greek and Macedonian Art of War</p>
                                    <p>"As it turned out, the obvious clearly stated, and combined with new observations, was sometimes close to revolutionary."<br/>- Wallace Stegner on John Wesley Powell</p>
                                    <p>"Focusing is about saying no."<br/>- Steve Jobs</p>
                                    <p>"The very word "secrecy" is repugnant in a free and open society; and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths and to secret proceedings. We decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweighed the dangers which are cited to justify it. Even today, there is little value in opposing the threat of a closed society by imitating its arbitrary restrictions. Even today, there is little value in insuring the survival of our nation if our traditions do not survive with it."<br/>- John F. Kennedy</p>

                                    <p>"Semper aut discere, aut docere, aut scribere dulce habui."<br/>- Bede</p>
                                    <p>"The qualities that made for success in a fighter-pilot seemed to be just those sturdy qualities that made for success in other professions; observation, initiative, determination, courage, including the courage to run away. In course of time it appeared that men who had a private axe to grind beyond the public axe of the King's enemies were especially successful."<br/>- Jim Bailey, The Sky Suspended</p>
                                    <p>"Everything about it was visibly mis-shapen, corrupt, crawling, verminous; for a time I could not bear to look at it, and passed with averted eyes; recovering from this weakness, I forced myself to look, and to face day by day the question: a thing so obviously, so incontrovertibly, so indefensibly bad, why had Scott done it?"<br/>- R. G. Collingwood on the Albert Memorial</p>
                                    <p>"If your standards are low, you're going to stop pretty early on in the process."<br/>- Aimee Mann</p>

                                    <p>"The late Richard Feynman, a superb physicist, said once as we talked about the laser that the way to tell a great idea is that, when people hear it, they say, 'Gee, I could have thought of that.'"<br/>- Charles Townes, How the Laser Happened</p>
                                    <p>"If we chose always to be wise we should rarely need to be virtuous. But inclinations which we could easily overcome irresistibly attract us. We give in to slight temptations and minimize the danger. We fall insensibly into dangerous situations, from which we could easily have safeguarded ourselves, but from which we cannot withdraw without heroic efforts which appal us. So finally, as we tumble into the abyss, we ask God why he has made us so feeble. But, in spite of ourselves, He replies through our consciences: 'I have made you too feeble to climb out of the pit, because I made you strong enough not to fall in.'"<br/>- Rousseau, Confessions, Cohen trans.</p>
                                    <p>"Constantly fortified with the new blood of immigrants who saw America as a place where anything was possible, the nation had adopted an ethos that elevated problem solving to the status of religion."<br/>- John Hoyt Williams, A Great and Shining Road</p>
                                    <p>"That 95 per cent. fail of those who start in business upon their own account seems incredible, and yet such are said to be the statistics upon the subject."<br/>- Andrew Carnegie, 1896</p>
